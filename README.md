A simple Reddit API wrapper implemented in Rust.

## Disclaimer

Roux is still in very early development, lots of documentation and features
are missing. In the mean time it's probably better to use one of these
alternatives:

* [orca](https://github.com/IntrepidPig/orca)
* [rawr](https://github.com/Aurora0001/rawr)
